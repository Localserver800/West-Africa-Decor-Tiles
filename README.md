## Getting Started with Base44

Base44 is a platform that allows you to build web applications using natural language prompts. To get started with Base44, you will need to:

1.  **Sign up for a Base44 account:** Visit the [Base44 website](https://www.base44.com/) and create a new account.
2.  **Create a new project:** Once you have created an account, you can create a new project for the ERP Decor Tiles application.
3.  **Describe your application:** Use natural language prompts to describe the features and functionality of your application. For example, you can start by saying "Create a web application for a tile shop called ERP Decor Tiles."

## Development Process

The development process with Base44 will involve the following steps:

1.  **Initial App Generation:** Provide a high-level description of the application to Base44. This will generate the initial version of the application with a built-in backend and database.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use natural language prompts to iteratively refine the application. For example, you can say "Add a product catalog with a search bar" or "Create a shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items."
3.  **Data Modeling:** Define the data models for your application, such as `Product`, `Order`, and `User`. You can do this by describing the fields and relationships of each model in natural language.
4.  **UI Design:** Customize the user interface of your application by describing the layout, colors, and fonts you want to use. You can also provide a reference to an existing website, such as Jumia, to guide the design process.
5.  **Integrations:** Connect to external services, such as Stripe for payments or Slack for notifications, by describing the desired integrations in natural language.

## Deployment

Base44 automatically handles the hosting and deployment of your application. Once you are happy with your application, you can deploy it to a production environment with a single click.
